## 🚀 Next 3 Steps (Do These Now)

### Step 1: EAS Login and Project Setup (5 minutes)

Open Terminal in your project directory and run:

### Step 2: Set Up Apple Developer Credentials (10 minutes)

```bash
# Configure iOS certificates and provisioning profiles
eas credentials -p ios

```

**What this does:** Creates the certificates needed to sign your iOS app

### Step 3: Create Your First iOS Build (20 minutes)

```bash
# Build for iOS App Store
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# This will:
# - Build your React Native app
# - Sign it with your certificates
# - Create an .ipa file for App Store submission
# - Take about 15-20 minutes
```
