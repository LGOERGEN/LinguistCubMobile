## Next Steps for App Store Submission

### Phase 3B: Apple Developer Setup (Required)
1. **Create Apple Developer Account** ($99/year)
   - Go to https://developer.apple.com/programs/
   - Enroll in the Apple Developer Program
   - Verify your identity (may take 24-48 hours)

2. **Set up App Store Connect**
   - Log into https://appstoreconnect.apple.com
   - Create a new app with bundle ID: `com.linguistcub.mobile`
   - Fill in basic app information

### Phase 3C: Build Generation
3. **Generate Production Build**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/lgoergen/Documents/Repositories/LinguistCubMobile

   # Login to Expo account (if not already logged in)
   eas login

   # Build for iOS App Store
   eas build --platform ios --profile production
   ```

4. **Generate Screenshots** (Use iOS Simulator)
   - Open app in iOS Simulator (iPhone 14 Pro Max for 6.7" screenshots)
   - Take screenshots of key screens:
     - Home screen with child profiles
     - Category selection screen
     - Word tracking interface
     - Statistics/milestone screen
     - Settings screen
   - Screenshots should be 1290x2796 pixels (6.7" display)

### Phase 3D: App Store Connect Setup
5. **Upload Build to App Store Connect**
   - EAS will automatically upload your build
   - Or use Transporter app from Mac App Store
   - Build will appear in App Store Connect after processing (10-60 minutes)

6. **Complete App Store Listing**
   - Add app description (from APP_STORE_METADATA.md)
   - Upload screenshots
   - Set category: Education
   - Set age rating: 4+
   - Add keywords
   - Set pricing (Free recommended for initial launch)

### Phase 3E: Submission
7. **Submit for Review**
   - Review all information
   - Submit for App Store review
   - Typical review time: 24-48 hours
   - Address any feedback from Apple if rejected

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Check build status
eas build:list

# Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# Generate screenshots using simulator
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 14 Pro Max"
npx expo run:ios --configuration Release

# Check app configuration
npx expo doctor
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Build fails**: Check that all dependencies are compatible
- **Asset issues**: Ensure icon.png is exactly 1024x1024 pixels
- **Bundle ID conflicts**: Verify com.linguistcub.mobile is unique in App Store Connect
